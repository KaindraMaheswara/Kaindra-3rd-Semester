RELATIONAL LOGIC

Propositional Logic vs Relational Logic
- Constants refer to atomic propositions / logival constants.
- Compound sentences capture relationships among propositions.

How to represent general concepts?
ex : if person I knows person II, person II knows person I
- In Propositional Logic:
    1. I knows II (a)
    2. II knows I (b)
    - a -> b
- In relational Logic:
    - use the function knows(a, b)
    1. I = x
    2. II = y
    ï€¢x,y (knows(x,y) -> knows(y,x))
